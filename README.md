# SimplyDeep
A simple introduction to deep learning


# A simple introduction to deep learning
## Haiping Lu - University of Sheffield

### Why
* We are teaching a class of 200+ MSc students with diverse background. 
* We need to move from a traditional machine learning course without much deep learning to a modern one with these cool words.
* Based on my experience in developing the [Scalable Machine Learning](https://github.com/haipinglu/ScalableML), I decided to start this project aiming to give a **simple** introduction to deep learning while bridging our traditional materials with modern materials.

### How
* Most materials will be adapted from internet sources, with acknowledgement properly given. If you find I've used your materials but did not acknowledge it, please let me know and I will fix it as soon as I can. 
* For transition, I will introduce these materials in small blocks at the end of each traditional machine learning lecture.
* The objective is to keep things as simple as possible, and make our transition as smooth as possible.
* Feedback from all is essential to grow this project and benefit more. Thank you!

### What (contents)
* Session 1: Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch
