# SimplyDeep: A Simple Introduction to Deep Learning

[Haiping Lu](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/H.Lu/) - The University of Sheffield

If you find the code useful, please star the repository.

**Simple** is the key focus here. If you think this can be made simpler, please let me know.

### Why
* We are teaching a class of 200+ MSc students with diverse background. 
* We need to transform a traditional machine learning course [MLAI](https://github.com/maalvarezl/MLAI) without much deep learning to a modern one with these cool words.
* Based on my experience in co-developing [Scalable Machine Learning](https://github.com/haipinglu/ScalableML) for three years from scratch, this project aims to
  * give a **simple** introduction to deep learning 
  * bridge our traditional materials with modern materials
  * reduce/remove unnecessary materials in existing sources to focus on the core concepts

### How
* Most materials will be adapted from internet sources, with acknowledgement properly given. If you find I've used your materials but did not acknowledge it, please let me know and I will fix it as soon as I can. 
* For transition, I will introduce these materials in small blocks at the end of each traditional machine learning lecture.
* The objective is to keep things as simple as possible, and make our transition as smooth as possible.
* Feedback from all is essential to grow this project and benefit more. Thank you!

### What

We will cover the following topics:
* Lab 1: Linear Regression with PyTorch
* Lab 2: Autoencoder for Unsupervised Feature Learning
* Lab 3: Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification
* Lab 4: Data Preparation and Transfer Learning
* Lab 5 - Variational Autoencoder for Deep Generative Learning
* PyroLab 1: Bayesian Linear Regression for Generative Learning with Pyro
* PyroLab 2: Variational Autoencoder for Deep Generative Learning

### GPU
**GPU** computing will be lightly touched only. Those interested are encouraged to refer to references and try out **free GPU access** provided by [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) if you do not have one yet. See [Google Colab Free GPU Tutorial](https://medium.com/deep-learning-turkey/google-colab-free-gpu-tutorial-e113627b9f5d)
