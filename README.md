# SimplyDeep: A Simple Introduction to Deep Learning
## Haiping Lu - University of Sheffield

**Simple** is the key focus here. If you think this can be made simpler, let me know please.

### Why
* We are teaching a class of 200+ MSc students with diverse background. 
* We need to transform a traditional machine learning course [MLAI](https://github.com/maalvarezl/MLAI) without much deep learning to a modern one with these cool words.
* Based on my experience in developing the course [Scalable Machine Learning](https://github.com/haipinglu/ScalableML) for three years from scratch, this project aims to
  * give a **simple** introduction to deep learning 
  * bridge our traditional materials with modern materials
  * reduce/remove unnecessary materials in existing sources to focus on the core concepts

### How
* Most materials will be adapted from internet sources, with acknowledgement properly given. If you find I've used your materials but did not acknowledge it, please let me know and I will fix it as soon as I can. 
* For transition, I will introduce these materials in small blocks at the end of each traditional machine learning lecture.
* The objective is to keep things as simple as possible, and make our transition as smooth as possible.
* Feedback from all is essential to grow this project and benefit more. Thank you!

### What
#### What's not covered
**GPU** computing, considering 200+ users, though we will provide references when convenient.
#### Contents
* Session 1: Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch
